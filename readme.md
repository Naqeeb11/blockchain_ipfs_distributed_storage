# Distributed Storage System Using Blockchain and IPFS

## Introduction

Storing data has evolved during the years in order to accommodate the rising needs of companies and individuals.

We need not just faster drives and networks, we need a new approach, a new concept of doing data storage. At present, the best approach to satisfying current demands for storing data seems to be distributed storage

## Architecture

1. Smart contracts are written in solidity .

2. While uploading the data in IPFS, the protocol returns a uniqueâ€‹ hash

value for the data via gateway.

3. This hash value is securely stored in Blockchain. Based

on the hash value, the data can be retrieved.
